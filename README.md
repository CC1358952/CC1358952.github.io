# Caleb Cort – Personal Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This site serves as a central hub to showcase my background, projects, certifications, and skills.

## 👋 About Me

Hi! I'm **Caleb Cort**, a second-year Finance major at the University of Georgia's Terry College of Business. I'm pursuing a minor in Computer Science and a FinTech certificate. My passion lies in integrating financial information with technology and algorithms.

My journey began with a fascination for baseball statistics, leading me to establish my high school's Baseball Data & Analytics Program. Now, I aim to bridge the communication gap between IT and financial teams, facilitating data-driven, people-first, and fiscally responsible business decisions. Post-graduation, I plan to pursue a Master's in Business Analytics to further connect my Finance and Computer Science studies.

Beyond technical skills, I'm a relationship-oriented individual who enjoys creating solutions tailored to people's needs.
