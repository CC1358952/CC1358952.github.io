                                    Big data has transformed the world of business. Yet many people don't understand what big data and business intelligence are, or how to apply the techniques to their day-to-day jobs. This course addresses that knowledge gap, giving businesspeople practical methods to create quick and relevant business forecasts using big data.

Join Professor Michael McDonald and discover how to use predictive analytics to forecast key performance indicators of interest, such as quarterly sales, projected cash flow, or even optimized product pricing. Learn how to gather, compute, and use basic financial ratios, and then how to apply those ratios for forecasting purposes looking at key outcomes for the firm. All you need is Microsoft Excel. Michael uses the built-in formulas, functions, and calculations to perform regression analysis, calculate confidence intervals, and stress test your results. You'll walk away from the course able to immediately begin creating forecasts for your own business needs.

                                    Financial reports are not just summaries of the past—they also include predictions for the future. In fact, most financial institutions are more interested in future performance than historical trends. Banks want to know your future cash flow; investors want to know future profits. In this course, Jim and Kay Stice explains how to create forecasted financial statements for your company. Learn how to use past data such as cost of goods sold, depreciation expenses, and levels of inventory, and understand what caused those numbers to fluctuate over time. Then you can learn how to use the information as the basis for forecasting, applying a simple but powerful equation: assets = liability + equity. You get hands-on practice building three different documents: a forecasted income statement, a forecasted balance sheet, and a forecasted statement of cash flow. Throughout the course, Jim and Kay use famous business cases—like Home Depot’s 1985 cash-flow crisis—to illustrate the importance of accurate financial forecasts and their impact on business decisions.

                                    Financial planning and analysis (FP&A) is a rapidly evolving field within corporate finance and one of the most important functions of any successful finance department. While there are a number of different data visualization tools that support FP&A, most companies rely on the ubiquitous Microsoft Excel.

In this course, join instructor, CSP, and CPA Carl Seidman as he provides a comprehensive overview of how to harness the power of Excel for forecasting, planning, analysis, and modeling. Along the way, find out why Excel can be so useful for FP&A, including coverage of how to leverage key analytic tools such as dynamic data tables, dynamic data ranges, dynamic data arrays, and more.

                                    If you work in the financial sector, one tool that may not come to mind when thinking about the day-to-day work in finance is SQL—structured query language. But SQL is the programming language used to query data, so it’s extremely useful for anyone who works with vast stores of information, including financial professionals. As more and more data gets produced from the proliferation of modern tools and technologies, it’s increasingly important to know how to handle all the new data, and in this course, Megan Lieu shows you how to do just that using SQL. She starts with the background of SQL, including use cases, SQL data types, how to query data, how to use functions to perform calculations, and more. She then delves into finance-specific applications of SQL, giving an overview of how SQL is used in finance, the difference when using data in fintech vs. finance, and shows you how to use SQL in combination with a more familiar financial sector tool, Excel.
